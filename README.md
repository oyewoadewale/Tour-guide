Tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. Project which comes under Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program


Project Overview
I will be making your own multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about a city you are very familiar with. The goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know.
